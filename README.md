# Knapsack

Consider a problem found in packing shipping containers on docks. There is a
collection of objects; each object has a value, and a weight. The shipping
container has a weight capacity which it can hold. The goal is to pack the
shipping container in order to:

1) maximize the sum total of the values of the objects put into the container.
2) fill up the container so that the total weight is less than or equal to the
   container's capacity.

This well-known optimization problem is known as the knapsack problem.
To solve this problem on a D-Wave system, we reformulate it as a quadratic
unconstrained binary optimization problem (QUBO).

## Usage

To run a small demo, run the command:

```bash
python main.py data/small.csv 50
```

The command-line arguments specify the Python program, a small data set, and the
maximum weight (in kilograms). The small data set file includes objects,
provided as pairs (weight, value).  The answer should include three objects,
with combined weight of 45 kg, below the maximum of 50 kg. Their summed value is
205, which agrees with the reported energy.

To run the full demo, run the command:

```bash
python main.py
```

To run a bigger demo, run the command:

```bash
python main.py data/very_large.csv 190
```

To run a much bigger demo, run the command:

```bash
python main.py data/huge.csv 400
```

## Code Overview

main.py contains an implementation of Andrew Lucas's improved formulation[2]
based on his original writeup[1]. Lucas's formulation adds slack variables to
handle the less-than-or-equal-to constraint.

The x variables in main.py determine whether the weights are to be included in
the selected set, and the y variables in main.py are the slack variables.  The
code separates out the x-x, x-y, and y-y terms.

The Hamiltonian includes the constraints that the sum of the y variables must be
1; the weight of the knapsack can take only one value. There is also the
constraint that the sum of all the weights multiplied by the x variables must be
less than or equal to the knapsack's weight capacity. The energy term multiplies
the costs by the x variables, in order to represent the overall weight placed
into the knapsack. The slack variables turn the inequality into an equality.
